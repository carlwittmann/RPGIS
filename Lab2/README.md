| *The 100 Acre Woods* | *The Lake District* | *Middle Earth* |


If I had to pinpoint where it all started, it would be here: Christopher Robin's 100 Acre Woods, the Lake District as imagined by the Swallows & Amazons, and Tolkein's Middle Earth. I spent a lot of time in libraries as a child; throughout the '90s in Riyadh, there was exactly one store that sold English novels - Jarir Bookstore - and selection was limited. The libraries at the American International School, however, were *stacked to the roof* with books. It is difficult to understate just how important those libraries were to me - the novels I read sitting on that worn industrial carpet between shelves played a significant part in shaping who I am today. I can remember the sound of basketballs outside while other kids were at recess, the way the small dusty windows filtered the midday desert sun, the way the waterfountain tasted, the first time I skipped class (after pulling my first Discworld novel off the shelf)... and I remember looking for maps. I remember going book by book down the aisles, flipping through the first few pages, and collecting stacks of novels that began with a map.

I was obsessed with those maps. I spent hours pouring over them, imagining what might be and what might have been. As I read through the novels, I constantly referenced the maps. I started drawing my own maps to extend the world beyond the borders of the printed page. I was absolutely captivated.

Looking back, I can't help but ponder the dichotomy between the maps I was drawn to as a child and the maps I produce as an aspiring geospatial professional. I fell in love with maps not for the questions they answered, but for the questions they posed, yet when I personally approach a cartographic task I feel compelled to produce a nearly-infallible document - after all, shouldn't that be the goal of a cartographer? It certainly was drilled into me over the course of my degree, and I began to view everything I do through an empirical lens: If I want to be taken seriously, I should make serious maps. 

Over this past semester, I've started to realize that I may have limited myself somewhat in that regard. I've forgotten that maps can be fun, or artistic, or playful. This lab was an opportunity for me to take a step back and reflect upon the maps which first sparked my interest in cartography, and which ultimately led to this essay.

In the planning phase of this project, (and at your recommendation), I spent a significant amount of time browsing through Erwin Raisz's *General Cartography*

Please offer me the https:// link to a GitHub folder. That folder should have:

A copy of the COMMENTED source code (.html, .js, .css) you made.
A README.md that gives me:
A title
A screenshot of a view of your map that you feel is interesting (how to put screenshots into a READMELinks to an external site.).
A working link to your map (doesn't have to be on GitHub, per se). 
Collaborations and reliance on other resources: Please document any so I know what you have been able to find and what you have added. What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one? What did you contribute to others? What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect? (Commenting in the code itself at the places in question is helpful.) 
Reflective analysis: A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your interactive map is conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
