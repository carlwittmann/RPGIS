When I think back to the maps that first captured my childhood imagination - Christopher Robin's 100 Acre Woods; the Lake District as imagined by the Swallows & Amazons; Tolkein's Middle Earth -

Please offer me the https:// link to a GitHub folder. That folder should have:

A copy of the COMMENTED source code (.html, .js, .css) you made.
A README.md that gives me:
A title
A screenshot of a view of your map that you feel is interesting (how to put screenshots into a READMELinks to an external site.).
A working link to your map (doesn't have to be on GitHub, per se). 
Collaborations and reliance on other resources: Please document any so I know what you have been able to find and what you have added. What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one? What did you contribute to others? What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect? (Commenting in the code itself at the places in question is helpful.) 
Reflective analysis: A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your interactive map is conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
